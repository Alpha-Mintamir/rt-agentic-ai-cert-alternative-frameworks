## 📚 Lessons in This Repository

### Lesson 1 – [OpenAI Python SDK: Quickstart Tutorial with Code Examples](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/iyQlDcuqY6kW)

Learn how to use the official OpenAI Python SDK to build AI features without heavy frameworks. You’ll install the SDK, configure your API key securely, and call core capabilities like chat, embeddings, and vision. Along the way, you'll explore when raw SDK usage is ideal—and when to consider layering on orchestration tools.

- **Coming soon:** OpenAI Agents SDK, Crew AI, n8n, AutoGen, Pydantic AI & more
