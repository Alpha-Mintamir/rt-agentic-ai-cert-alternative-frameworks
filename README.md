## ðŸ“š Lessons in This Repository

### Lesson 1 â€“ [OpenAI Python SDK: Quickstart Tutorial with Code Examples](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/iyQlDcuqY6kW)

Learn how to use the official OpenAI Python SDK to build AI features without heavy frameworks. Youâ€™ll install the SDK, configure your API key securely, and call core capabilities like chat, embeddings, and vision. Along the way, you'll explore when raw SDK usage is idealâ€”and when to consider layering on orchestration tools.

### Lesson 2 - [OpenAI Agents SDK Tutorial: Building Autonomous Multi-Agent AI Systems](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/5hubr48CnmGH)

In this article, youâ€™ll get a friendly, hands-on guide to building AI agents with the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. Youâ€™ll learn how to make agents that can **think, act, use tools, follow rules, delegate tasks, and remember context** - basically, AI that actually gets things done. By the end, youâ€™ll be ready to create practical, intelligent applications for text, code, or even multi-modal workflows, all in a smooth and approachable way.

- **Coming soon:** Crew AI, n8n, AutoGen, Pydantic AI & more
